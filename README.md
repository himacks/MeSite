Next Steps:

- create a mountain ridge line with like 4 mountain ridges all one another behind eachother
- as the user scrolls it expanded the largest mountain range in the back until its fully expanded and reveals all of its contents
- keeps scrolling till end of frame contents and then next ridge starts expanding. almost like flipping through a collection of folders?
